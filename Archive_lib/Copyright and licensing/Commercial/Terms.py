TERMS i.f. “Software Module” or “Module”. Herein a Software Module (Module) is a component of a Software Application which contains one or more programmatic routines, methods, functions or attributes. One or more independent modules make up a Software Application. Each module serves one or more unique and separate Software Application operations. Examples of “Modules” include but are not limited to a Python file containing individually callable methods, functions or attributes; a Perl “.pm” or “.pl” file, a Dynamic Load Library (.DLL) file, or an “.exe” file.

TERMS i.g. “Framework”. Herein a Framework is a concrete or conceptual platform where common code with general or specific functionality can be selectively used, specialized or overridden by developers or users. Frameworks are made up of libraries of Framework Modules which are reusable within one or more Software Application(s) regardless of the Software Application’s “certain specific and defined functional end results”. 

TERMS i.h. “Software Application”. Herein a Software Application is one or more Modules, to be used in an interoperable manner, in order to bring about “certain specific and defined functional end results”. A Software Application is defined by the sum of its component parts and modules, and the term does not in any way apply to the individual parts, components or modules outside this united, interoperable grouping regardless of the part’s, component’s or module’s individual functionality. 

TERMS i.i. “Framework Module”. Herein a Framework Module is a single Software Module containing code with reusable functionality that can be selectively used in whole or in part, with or without modification, as a component of a Software Application. A Framework Module is reusable within one or more Software Application(s) regardless of the Software Application’s “certain specific and defined functional end results”.

TERMS i.j. “Application Module”. Herein an Application Module is a single Software Module containing code with specific functionality upon which a Software Application’s “certain specific and defined functional end results” are dependent. Constituent Application Module(s) are inherent to and defining of the Software Application’s character and are not useful outside of the Application Software’s “certain specific and defined functional end results”.
